I want to design a modern, responsive website for car parts. Create a clean, visually appealing landing page optimized for mobile and desktop. Use a bold automotive theme with strong contrasts, clean typography, and smooth animations. The target audience is existing/old users, so the interface should feel familiar, simple to navigate, and trustworthy.

🔹 Landing Page Requirements
1. Responsive Navigation Bar

Sticky header with logo, category links, search bar, and login/cart icons.

Mobile version should show a hamburger menu with a slide-in drawer.

Smooth transition on scroll (shrink or shadow).

2. Section 1 – Offers / New Arrivals (Hero Banner)

Full-width carousel / hero slider.

Showcase discounts, new arrivals, and trending parts.

Clear CTAs like Shop Now, Explore Parts, View Latest.

3. Section 2 – Featured Auto Parts

Horizontal scrollable cards (perfect for mobile).

Each part card includes:

Image

Part name

Price

Availability badge

“Quick View” or “Add to Cart” button

Smooth sliding animations on scroll.

4. Section 3 – Available Brands

Grid layout of brand logos.

Hover effects with subtle scale-up.

Responsive:

Mobile: 2–3 per row

Desktop: 5–6 per row

5. Section 4 – Car Manufacturer Cards

Cards with popular car companies (Toyota, Hyundai, BMW, Kia, etc.)

Clicking a card redirects to a filtered product listing page.

Hover animation + shadow.

6. Footer Section (New Requirement)
